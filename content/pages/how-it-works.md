# How It Works – Logic Health Management

## From Kickoff to First Claims

### 0. Readiness & ROI
- Panel size and payer mix review
- CCM/RPM fit analysis (e.g., HTN, CHF, COPD, DM)
- Baseline assumptions → initial ROI estimate

### 1. Connect Your EHR
- Templates and workflows set up in your environment
- Role‑based access and PHI minimization
- Bidirectional documentation (no duplicate entry)

### 2. Identify & Consent Patients
- Eligibility rules applied to your panel
- Documented consent captured per payer policy
- Welcome call and education scripts

### 3. Configure Care Plans & Devices
- **CCM:** Care plans, goals, tasks, and monthly cadence
- **RPM:** Thresholds and alert logic; cellular devices provisioned and shipped

### 4. Deliver Services
- Monthly CCM outreach by RN/MA care team
- Daily RPM review with protocol‑driven triage
- Escalations routed to practice clinicians with clear context

### 5. Document & Track Minutes
- Time logs with CCM vs RPM separation
- One‑provider‑per‑month safeguard
- Monthly provider summary for review/signature

### 6. Review, Bill, Improve
- Providers sign off; billing submits claims
- Denial watchlist and root‑cause feedback
- Program KPIs and quarterly optimization
