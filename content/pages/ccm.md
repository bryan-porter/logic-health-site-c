## What CCM Delivers
Proactive, monthly management for patients with multiple chronic conditions — improving continuity of care while generating predictable revenue.

## Eligibility (High Level)
- ≥ **2 chronic conditions** expected to last ≥12 months (or until death)
- Conditions place the patient at **significant risk** of death, acute exacerbation, or functional decline
- **Documented consent** and a **comprehensive care plan** in the medical record

## Common CPT Codes (Reference)
- **99490:** First 20 minutes of clinical staff time under general supervision
- **99439:** Each additional 20 minutes (add‑on to 99490)
- **99491:** 60 minutes of physician/APP time personally
- **99437:** Each additional 30 minutes (add‑on to 99491)

## How LogicHM Runs CCM
1. Monthly outreach by U.S.-based RN/MA team
2. Medication reconciliation, SDOH screening, goal review, coordination tasks
3. Escalation to provider when clinical thresholds or concerns are met
4. Audit‑ready documentation and time logs in your EHR
5. Provider reviews/signs the monthly summary; billing submits 99490/99439 or 99491/99437 as appropriate
