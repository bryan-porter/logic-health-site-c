# Results

## What We Measure
- **Clinical:** BP control, A1c trends, avoidable ED visits/readmissions
- **Operational:** Enrollment rate, monthly engagement, adherence (RPM), documentation completeness
- **Financial:** Clean claim rate, denial rate, net revenue per patient, churn

## Example Impact (Illustrative)
- **Hypertension RPM:** ≥70% of active patients transmit ≥16 days/month after onboarding program; earlier outreach reduces severe outliers.
- **CCM for multimorbidity:** Regular medication reconciliation and SDOH checks reduce gaps in care and support fewer avoidable ED visits.
- **Denial avoidance:** Clear separation of CCM/RPM minutes and one‑provider safeguards reduce recoupment risk.

> Actual results vary by population, payer mix, and program maturity.
