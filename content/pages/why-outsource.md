# Why Outsource – Logic Health Management

## The Short Answer
Because your team is already stretched. CCM/RPM succeed when they're **run like a service line** — consistent outreach, daily monitoring, meticulous documentation, and clean billing — not an afterthought between visits.

## In‑House Challenges
- **Hiring & training:** Recruiting RNs/MAs for outreach/triage adds fixed cost and turnover risk.
- **Operational complexity:** Panel identification, consent, device logistics, time tracking, and QA require SOPs and tooling.
- **EHR friction:** Manual notes and duplicate data entry lead to gaps and denials.
- **Compliance risk:** Minutes must be counted correctly; CCM and RPM time cannot overlap.
- **Device wastage (RPM):** "Dark devices" erode ROI if adherence isn't actively managed.

## What Outsourcing to LogicHM Delivers
- **Speed to value:** Launch in weeks, not quarters; we bring the playbooks and staff.
- **Variable cost structure:** Scale up or down without adding FTEs.
- **Documentation discipline:** Audit‑ready notes, minutes, and monthly summaries.
- **Denial prevention:** One‑provider‑per‑month safeguards; clear payer‑specific rules.
- **Patient adherence:** Proactive follow‑up to keep RPM transmissions and CCM minutes on track.
