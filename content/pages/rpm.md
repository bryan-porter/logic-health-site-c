# Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)

## Why RPM
Daily physiologic data reveals deterioration earlier, enabling timely intervention for hypertension, heart failure, COPD, diabetes, and other chronic conditions.

## Devices & Data
- Cellular **BP monitors**, **weight scales**, **pulse oximeters**, **glucometers**
- Cellular first to avoid app pairing friction and "dark devices"
- Thresholds and alerts configured per diagnosis and provider preference

## Common CPT Codes (Reference)
- **99453:** Initial setup and patient education (one‑time)
- **99454:** Device supply, provisioning, and data transmission **(requires ≥16 days of data in 30 days)**
- **99457:** First 20 minutes of treatment management per month
- **99458:** Each additional 20 minutes

> RPM time cannot overlap with CCM minutes. Count separately.

## How LogicHM Runs RPM
1. Provision and ship cellular kits; confirm receipt and first successful reading
2. Daily review by RN/MA; protocol‑based outreach and coaching
3. Escalation to providers for out‑of‑range or trend concerns
4. EHR documentation and monthly summaries for signature
5. Denial prevention: 16‑day rule adherence, time tracking, one‑provider safeguards

## Program KPIs
- Transmission adherence rate
- Time‑to‑intervention for sustained out‑of‑range readings
- Patient retention across 90/180 days
- Net revenue per enrolled patient
