A focused, **12‑week cadence** can cut denials 20–40% in small environments. The key is to **attack the top 5 root causes** and measure relentlessly.

## Your top 5 (almost everywhere)
1. **Eligibility & coverage** not verified or outdated
2. **Prior authorization** missing or expired
3. **Coding edits** (bundling, modifier issues, laterality)
4. **Medical necessity**/policy mismatches
5. **Timely filing** blown

## Weekly rhythm (1–2 hours)
- **Week 1–2**: Baseline. Pull 90 days of denials; group by payer + reason; find top 5 and write owner for each.
- **Week 3–6**: Build controls.
  - Eligibility: run day‑before checks; auto‑reschedule or cash‑pay scripting.
  - Prior auth: pre‑visit bot/checklist; stop scheduling without #.
  - Coding: maintain a "modifiers map" cheat sheet.
  - Med necessity: surface policy links in scheduling and coding notes.
  - Timely filing: color‑coded **aging board** with hard stops.
- **Week 7–10**: Tighten. Audits on 20 random claims/week; publish a **scorecard**.
- **Week 11–12**: Lock it in. SOPs + training; start monthly reviews.

## Small hospital specifics
- Centralize denials across clinics into **one queue**.
- Create **"quick appeal kits"** by denial reason with standard language.
- Track denials by **service location** to spot outlier clinics.

## Metrics that matter
- Initial **clean claim rate**
- **Days in AR** and % > 90 days
- **Appeal success** % by payer
- Staff **touches per claim** (lower is better)

## Tools you already have
- A shared spreadsheet (source of truth)
- Payer portals and standard forms
- A weekly 30‑minute stand‑up with the owners for each top cause
