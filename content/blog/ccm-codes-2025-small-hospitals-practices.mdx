Chronic Care Management (CCM) remains one of the most reliable ways for **practices and small hospitals** to fund longitudinal, team‑based support for patients with multiple chronic conditions. In 2025, the fundamentals haven't changed: success is mostly about **clean eligibility, reliable time capture, and defensible documentation.**

## Core codes to know (confirm payer rules)
- **99490**: 20 minutes of **clinical staff** CCM in a calendar month, under physician/other QHP direction.
- **99439**: Each additional 20 minutes of clinical staff CCM, same month (add‑on).
- **99491**: 60 minutes of CCM **personally provided** by physician/other QHP.
- **99437**: Each additional 30 minutes for 99491 (add‑on).
- **99487**: **Complex CCM**: 60 minutes of clinical staff time with moderate-to-high complexity care planning.
- **99489**: Each additional 30 minutes for 99487 (add‑on).
- **PCM (99424–99427)**: Principal Care Management for a **single high‑risk condition** (QHP‑provided vs clinical staff).

> Tip: For small hospitals with provider‑based clinics, confirm whether the clinic is billing **facility vs non‑facility** and align documentation language accordingly.

## Eligibility and enrollment (fast, clean, repeatable)
1. **Two+ chronic conditions** expected to last at least 12 months with significant risk—confirm once, **re‑affirm annually**.
2. Obtain **informed consent** (verbal or written per payer), note how to withdraw.
3. Document a **comprehensive, shareable care plan** accessible to the **patient and the team**.

## Time capture that actually works
- Track time **as you work**, not retrospectively.
- Attribute minutes to the **correct month** and **code family** (CCM vs PCM).
- Separate **clinical staff** vs **QHP‑provided** time (e.g., 99490 vs 99491).
- Use **standard snippets** for common interventions (med reconciliation, SNF calls, home services coordination) to keep notes consistent.

## Staffing models for small teams
- **Medical assistant or LPN as CCM coordinator**, escalates to RN for complex needs.
- **One RN per 150–200 active CCM patients** (tune to your panel complexity).
- For small hospitals, **centralize** across clinics to reduce idle time and improve coverage.

## Facility nuances (small hospitals)
- Define a clear **cost center** and routing rules for CCM activities performed by outpatient departments vs clinics.
- Align the **care plan template** with hospital care management notes to avoid duplicate work.

## Documentation: minimum viable note
- **Minute log** with date/time blocks.
- **Risk & goals** refreshed quarterly.
- **Interventions** tied to specific goals/barriers.
- **Care transitions** (ED, inpatient, SNF) flagged and summarized.

## Quality signals to watch monthly
- % patients with **documented consent** and care plan.
- **Minutes distribution**: how many patients cross 20/40/60 minutes.
- **30‑day readmissions** and ED utilization for CCM enrollees vs baseline.
- **Open tasks >14 days** (care gaps stalling time capture).

## Launch checklist (30 days)
- [ ] Choose code set (CCM only vs CCM+PCM).
- [ ] Finalize templates for **consent**, **care plan**, **minute log**.
- [ ] Train MA/LPN/RN on **what counts** toward minutes.
- [ ] Build **weekly huddle** with escalation rules.
- [ ] Start with **50–75 patients**; scale to 200+ as workflows stabilize.
