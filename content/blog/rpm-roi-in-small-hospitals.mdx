Remote Patient Monitoring isn't just for large health systems with deep pockets. Small hospitals—especially Critical Access Hospitals—can capture meaningful clinical and financial value **if** the program design fits operational reality.

## The CAH Advantage

Critical Access Hospitals benefit from **cost‑based reimbursement** on outpatient services. That means when you bill RPM codes, Medicare pays your **actual cost plus a margin**—not a fixed fee schedule.

- **99453** (device setup & patient education): One‑time per episode
- **99454** (device supply with data transmission): Monthly per device
- **99457** (interactive monitoring, first 20 min): Monthly clinical time
- **99458** (each additional 20 min): Extends 99457 when needed
- **99091** (collection/interpretation of data): Alternative code for complex cases

## Financial Model (50-Patient Pilot)

**Assumptions:**
- 50 enrolled patients (CHF, hypertension, diabetes)
- Average 2 devices per patient (BP cuff + scale or CGM)
- 25 minutes clinical staff time per patient per month
- CAH cost‑based reimbursement ~135% of cost

**Monthly Revenue (estimated):**
- Device codes (99454): $1,800–2,400
- Clinical monitoring (99457/99458): $3,000–4,000
- Total: **~$5,000/month** ($60K/year)

**Costs:**
- Devices (amortized): ~$600/month
- Staff time (RN/MA): ~$2,000/month
- Platform/software: ~$800/month
- Total: **~$3,400/month**

**Net margin:** ~$1,600/month or **~$19K/year** for a 50‑patient panel.

Scale to 150–200 patients and you're funding a part‑time care coordinator **and** improving outcomes.

## Keys to Success

1. **Automate alerts** so staff only engage when clinically meaningful.
2. **Integrate with your EHR** to minimize duplicate documentation.
3. **Bundle with CCM** when patients qualify (most do).
4. **Track time religiously**—payers audit RPM heavily.

> LogicHM's RPM suite automates device provisioning, alert triage, and time capture. CAH partners routinely see 40–50% staff time savings vs. manual workflows.
