Annual Wellness Visits (AWVs) are one of the highest‑value, most under‑leveraged touchpoints in primary care. When you build a systematic workflow around **screening**, **documenting**, and **addressing** social determinants of health (SDoH), AWVs become the foundation for both better outcomes and **new billable services** (CCM, PCM, BHI).

## Why Z‑Codes Matter

**Z‑codes** (ICD‑10‑CM codes starting with Z55–Z65) capture social risk factors like:
- **Z59.0** — Homelessness
- **Z59.4** — Lack of adequate food
- **Z60.2** — Problems related to living alone
- **Z62.8** — Other problems related to upbringing
- **Z63.4** — Disappearance or death of family member
- **Z65.0** — Conviction in civil/criminal proceedings

Documenting these isn't just "nice to have"—it:
1. Supports care complexity for CCM/PCM eligibility.
2. Enables **risk adjustment** (especially in Medicare Advantage and ACOs).
3. Unlocks **Principal Illness Navigation (PIN)** codes when paired with serious illness.
4. Drives referrals to community resources (and trackable care coordination time).

## The AWV → Chronic Care Pipeline

A well‑executed AWV includes:

### 1. Health Risk Assessment (HRA)
Standardized questionnaire covering:
- Living situation
- Food security
- Transportation
- Caregiver burden
- Depression screening (PHQ‑2 or PHQ‑9)

### 2. Personalized Prevention Plan (PPP)
- Screenings due (mammogram, colonoscopy, etc.)
- Vaccinations
- Fall risk mitigation
- Advance care planning

### 3. Chronic Condition Identification
- Review problem list and labs
- Flag patients with **≥2 chronic conditions** expected to last ≥12 months → **CCM‑eligible**
- Flag serious illness (CHF, COPD, cancer) + cognitive/psychosocial need → **PCM/PIN‑eligible**

### 4. Document Z‑Codes
- Food insecurity → Z59.4
- Lives alone + depression → Z60.2 + F32.x
- Caregiver for spouse with dementia → Z63.6

## Downstream Revenue Opportunity

**Example patient:**
- 72‑year‑old with diabetes, hypertension, depression
- Lives alone, limited family support (Z60.2)
- Food insecurity (Z59.4)
- Screens positive for depression (F32.9)

**Billable services triggered:**
- **AWV** (G0438/G0439): Initial visit
- **CCM enrollment** (99490/99439): Chronic care coordination
- **BHI** (99484): Behavioral health integration for depression
- **PCM** (99424/99425/99426): If serious illness + functional impairment develops

**Annualized value:** AWV ($174) + CCM (~$600/year) + BHI (~$700/year) = **~$1,500/patient** with better coordinated care.

## Implementation Tips

1. **Automate HRA collection** (digital forms, patient portal).
2. **Train MAs to flag Z‑code triggers** during rooming.
3. **Pre‑populate PPP** from EHR data (overdue screenings, labs).
4. **Use AWV visit to enroll CCM** same‑day when eligible.
5. **Track Z‑code capture rate** as a quality metric.

> LogicHM's AWV workflow engine auto‑flags CCM/PCM/BHI eligibility based on HRA responses and problem list, then pre‑populates consent and enrollment forms for same‑day capture.
