Hospital‑at‑home (HaH) can expand capacity, improve satisfaction, and reduce avoidable transfers. For **small hospitals**, the winning approach is to start **tight and safe**, then scale.

## Governance & scope
- Define **eligibility**: conditions, distance radius, caregiver availability, home safety.
- Clarify **medical control** and escalation (ED, inpatient).
- Build a small **oversight committee**: medicine, nursing, pharmacy, quality, compliance.

## Staffing model
- **Virtual command**: RN hub (day) + on‑call QHP; case manager oversees length‑of‑stay.
- **Field**: paramedic or RN visits; vendor couriers for meds/equipment; PT/OT/RT as needed.
- **Night coverage**: tele‑nurse with clear escalation tree.

## Tech stack (minimal)
- Vitals devices (BP, SpO₂, thermometer; add scale, peak flow as needed)
- **Video** that works on low bandwidth
- A simple **visit scheduler** and an **incident log**
- Integration can wait—start with secure portals and export files you can audit

## Safety & quality
- **Same‑day response** times; **fall risk** checks; med reconciliation.
- Track **unplanned returns** to ED/inpatient, **device connectivity**, and **missed visits**.
- Run a weekly **morbidity & improvement** huddle.

## Billing & documentation basics
- Align orders, time, and progress notes to local policy; clearly mark **site of care**.
- Keep a "**home visit kit**" checklist and standard discharge materials.

## 60‑day path to first patients
1. Pick 1–2 DRG/condition bundles with clear criteria.
2. Draft SOPs and run a tabletop drill with 3 mock patients.
3. Contract vendors (DME, courier, tele, devices).
4. Train staff, go‑live with **3–5 patients**, and iterate.
