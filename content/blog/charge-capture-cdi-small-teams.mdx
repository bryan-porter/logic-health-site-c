You have more charge opportunity than you think—hidden in hand‑offs and free‑text. Here's how **small teams** can tighten charge capture and clinical documentation improvement (CDI) quickly.

## Start with three templates
1. **Procedure note** with required fields and common modifiers.
2. **Hospital/clinic visit note** with problem list, MDM leveling cues, and time (if time‑based).
3. **Supply/prosthetic addendum** for applicable lines.

## Edits you can maintain
- **Front‑end edits**: missing auth, invalid coverage, expired demographics.
- **Coding edits**: bundling conflicts, modifier requirements, laterality.
- **CDI prompts**: specificity cues (type, acuity, complication).

Keep edits in a single **living document** with payer links.

## Daily micro‑huddles (10 minutes)
- Yesterday's **missed charges** and root cause
- Top **open edits**
- "One fix" for the day (e.g., add a checkbox to a template)

## Small hospital wrinkles
- Standardize templates across provider‑based clinics; appoint a **CDI champion**.
- Align with inpatient CDI so terms and definitions don't conflict.

## Measure & celebrate
- **Charge lag** (service → posted)
- **% claims with edits** and rework time
- **Coder queries** volume and response time
- **Net revenue lift** after fixes (even small % adds up)
