# Medicare Billing Codes for CCM and RPM: A Practical Guide for Physician Practices & Small Hospitals

_Chronic Care Management (CCM) and Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) represent two of Medicare's most powerful tools for improving outcomes and generating predictable, recurring revenue for primary-care practices **and small hospitals** (including provider‑based clinics and CAHs). Yet the alphabet soup of CPT and HCPCS codes—and the constant stream of rule changes—often turns opportunity into administrative burden. This practical guide distills the latest federal guidance into a concise reference you can use today, while outlining how an expert partner like Logic Health Management (LogicHM) streamlines compliance and care._ [1] [2] [3]

> **Who this is for:** Independent and system‑owned physician practices, RHCs/FQHCs, and **small hospitals** running ambulatory CCM/RPM programs in hospital‑based or provider‑based clinic settings.

## Why Accurate Billing Matters

- **Reimbursement:** CCM and RPM can add hundreds of dollars in Part B revenue per patient per year, but only if every requirement is met.
- **Compliance:** The Office of Inspector General has signaled heightened scrutiny of RPM claims, with a focus on duplicate services and medical necessity. [4]
- **Patient Satisfaction:** Clean billing prevents surprise bills and underscores your commitment to transparent, value-based care.

## Decoding the Current **CCM** Code Set

Medicare recognizes six primary CPT codes for CCM services: [5]

| Code  | Monthly Work Described                                       | 2024 National Average Payment* | Citations |
|------:|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------:|:---------:|
| 99490 | 20 min of clinical staff time, 2+ chronic conditions          | $62                            | [5] [6]   |
| 99439 | Each additional 20 min (add‑on to 99490)                      | $48                            | [5]       |
| 99487 | 60 min of **complex** CCM (moderate/high complexity)          | $134                           | [5] [7]   |
| 99489 | Each additional 30 min **complex** CCM (add‑on to 99487)      | $71                            | [5]       |
| 99491 | 30 min of physician/APP time personally spent                 | $85                            |           |
| 99437 | Each additional 30 min physician/APP time (add‑on to 99491)   | $59                            |           |

\* _2024 non‑facility national payment rate; local rates and annual updates vary._

**Key requirements:**
- Two or more chronic conditions expected to last ≥ 12 months.
- Comprehensive, patient‑centric care plan in the EHR.
- Patient consent and 24/7 access to care team.
- **No double‑counting** of minutes when CCM overlaps with TCM, PCM, or other care‑management services. [8]

## Decoding the Current **RPM** Code Set

| Code  | When to Use                                 | 2024 National Average Payment* | Essential Rule                                                                             | Citations    |
|------:|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------:|
| 99453 | Device set‑up & patient education            | $20                            | ≥ 16 days of data in first 30‑day period                                                   | [9]          |
| 99454 | Device supply & data transmission            | $52                            | ≥ 16 days of data **each** 30‑day period                                                   | [10]         |
| 99457 | 20 min of interactive monitoring/management  | $48                            | Requires live, two‑way communication                                                        | [3]          |
| 99458 | Each additional 20 min                       | $39                            | May bill with 99457; **no double‑counting** with CCM, TCM, BHI, PCM                        | [8] [11]     |

\* _2024 non‑facility national payment rate; local rates and annual updates vary._

**Additional essentials:**
- Patient must be an "established patient" post‑PHE; document an initial E/M visit or equivalent. [12]
- Only **one** practitioner can bill RPM per patient per 30‑day period. [4]
- **RHC/FQHC:** Historically billed via HCPCS **G0511**. **In 2025, CMS finalized a transition to individually bill certain designated care‑management services (with a defined list), with a transition window. Confirm cut‑over timing and eligible codes with your MAC.** [14] [25] [26] [27]

## Regulatory Updates You Can't Miss (2025–2026)

- **2025 (RHC/FQHC):** CMS finalized use of **designated care‑management services** with individual CPT/HCPCS codes in RHCs/FQHCs (unbundling portions of care management from G0511), with a transition period in early 2025. **Action:** coordinate with your MAC on the exact effective dates, claim formatting, and any remaining uses of G0511. [25] [26] [27]

- **2026 (Final Rule):** CMS finalized **new RPM policy elements**, including _additional codes_ that address (a) device supply for **2–15 days** of data in a 30‑day period and (b) **10–19‑minute** RPM/RTM management interactions—while **99454 (16–30 days)** remains in place. **Action:** update charge capture logic, documentation prompts, and payer rulebooks ahead of CY‑2026. [22] [23] [24]

> _Always verify local MAC guidance and commercial‑payer mirrors before go‑live._

## Best‑Practice Checklist for **Compliant Billing**

- Verify patient eligibility and obtain **annual informed consent** (verbal or written).
- Document **time meticulously**; use EHR or partner dashboards that produce defensible audit trails.
- Confirm **16‑day** data capture for 99454/99453 until 2026 changes are in effect for new codes.
- Coordinate with other care‑management services to avoid **overlapping minutes**.
- Track **place‑of‑service nuances**—RHC/FQHC changes in 2025 and facility vs. non‑facility rates for small‑hospital clinics.
- Conduct periodic **internal audits**; educate clinical staff on rule changes.
