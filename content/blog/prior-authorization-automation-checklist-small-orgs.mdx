You don't need an enterprise bot army to calm prior authorization. Start with **five small automations** and a short set of metrics.

## The five to do first
1. **Eligibility‑based triggers**
   - If plan/policy requires PA for the scheduled CPT → open PA case automatically at scheduling.
2. **Smart attachments**
   - Standardize required docs per payer/policy; auto‑attach from the chart or checklist.
3. **Status polling**
   - Daily payer portal/API checks; push updates to one central PA queue.
4. **Expiration watch**
   - Alert at **T‑7 days** before auth expires; reschedule or renew.
5. **Denial handoff**
   - If denied, open an **appeal kit** with payer language and clinical references.

## Small hospital wrinkles
- Support **provider‑based clinics** and outpatient departments with a **shared queue**.
- Keep an "**auth exceptions**" list for emergent care and stabilize post‑service workflows.

## Minimal metrics
- PA **turnaround time** (submitted → decision)
- % **clean PAs** (accepted without rework)
- % visits/procedures **scheduled without PA** (should be near zero)
- **Appeal success** rate by payer/policy

## Human loops that matter
- Clinician sign‑off for edge cases
- A weekly "top 10 policies" review (update templates + scripting)
- Post‑denial learning posted back to scheduling and coding
