If MIPS still feels like alphabet soup, you're not alone. In 2025, most small organizations can succeed by **picking a lane**, **locking a monthly rhythm**, and **avoiding last‑quarter panic**.

## 3 steps to clarity
1. **Eligibility check**: Confirm each clinician's QPP status (special status, low‑volume thresholds, exemptions).
2. **Choose your lane**:
   - **Traditional MIPS** if your EHR supports your favorite measures and you want flexibility.
   - **MVP** (MIPS Value Pathway) if there's an option aligned to your specialty with clearer measure sets.
3. **Lock the rhythm**: Monthly extraction and review; quarterly attestations dry‑run.

## Small hospital considerations
- MIPS applies to **eligible clinicians**, not the hospital facility itself. Still, **central quality teams** can standardize measure capture across provider‑based clinics.
- Align ED/inpatient documentation so outpatient measures aren't undercut by transitions.

## Minimal viable operating model
- **Measure owner** per clinic/service line
- A **1‑page runbook** per measure: inclusion, exclusion, required fields, and where they live in the EHR
- **Monthly data pull** → 30‑minute review → remediation tasks

## Avoid the traps
- Waiting until Q4 (leads to avoidable gaps)
- Measure definitions drifting from the **current spec**
- Relying on free‑text instead of discrete fields

## Scoreboard to share
- % measures "on target" vs goal
- # records missing required fields
- Gap closure time (opened → corrected)
