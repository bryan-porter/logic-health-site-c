If you're running an MSO or multi-site physician group, you don't need to be sold on **Chronic Care Management (CCM)**.

You already know:

- Margin pressure is relentless.
- Value-based contracts keep ratcheting up quality expectations.
- Your practices are drowning in administrative work and can't "just do more between visits."

CCM should be a layup:

- It's recurring, predictable revenue.
- It supports quality metrics and value-based arrangements.
- It measurably improves continuity of care for high-risk patients.

And yet many MSOs quietly admit they're **leaving meaningful revenue and quality upside on the table** because they can't stand up CCM consistently across 10+ sites without running into:

- Hiring constraints
- Workflow chaos
- Compliance anxiety
- EHR fragmentation

This playbook is written for **COOs and CFOs** who want to fix that—**without adding headcount**.

## 1. Why CCM has to be a shared service—not a one-off per site

At single-practice scale, it's tempting to think:

> "We'll just have our MAs do CCM calls."

At MSO scale, that breaks down fast.

### Staffing & burnout

Each practice is already short on nurses and MAs. Asking local teams to bolt CCM on top of in-clinic throughput leads to:

- Inconsistent outreach
- Unreliable documentation
- Higher burnout and turnover

### Variation across locations

One practice builds a decent CCM workflow. Another hacks it together in spreadsheets. A third never really gets off the ground.

From an MSO view, that means:

- Three different programs
- Three different documentation patterns
- An unpredictable revenue stream

### Compliance & CPOM risk

The more ad hoc the model, the harder it is to ensure:

- Documentation consistently supports the codes billed
- Role boundaries are clear under your CPOM structure
- Supervision and consent are tracked in a defendable way

### Technology sprawl

If each site adopts a different tech workaround, you end up with:

- Parallel systems and duplicate documentation
- No single view of CCM enrollment, time, or outcomes across the network

That's why **CCM has to be built as a shared service**—a **single operating model** that runs across participating practices.

---

## 2. The end state you're aiming for

Before you touch workflows or the EHR, define what "good" looks like at the MSO level.

A mature shared-services CCM program has:

**1. One operating model across sites**

Common eligibility criteria, consent scripting, call cadence, and documentation standards. No "home-grown" variants per practice.

**2. A centralized care-management team**

Pooled nurses, MAs, and navigators working across your network under physician supervision. Local clinicians keep clinical authority; centralized staff handle the work between visits.

**3. EHR-embedded workflows**

CCM notes, tasks, and time logs that live in the EHR you already use. Providers see CCM activity in the chart—not in a separate portal.

**4. CPOM-sensitive governance**

Clearly documented separation between clinical decision-making and operational support. Management agreements and BAAs that match how work actually happens.

**5. Network-level measurement and ROI**

Enrollment, engagement, time logged, net revenue per enrolled patient, and utilization trends by site, payer, and condition.

**6. No incremental internal FTE requirement**

You don't have to build a full care-management department in-house just to get CCM off the ground.

That's the bar: **one model, many practices, no new internal headcount**.

## 3. The building blocks of a shared CCM operating model

### 3.1 Governance & CPOM: decide who owns what

For an MSO, governance is the foundation.

You need clarity on:

- Who **owns** the CCM program clinically (e.g., CMO, medical director, committee)?
- Who owns it operationally (e.g., COO, MSO ops leader)?
- How the care-management team relates to your **Friendly PC / physician entity** structure.

Practical steps:

- Document a **RACI** for physicians, APPs, centralized nurses/MAs/navigators, site managers, and any vendor.
- Ensure management agreements and BAAs reflect actual data flows and responsibilities.
- Align supervision rules (general vs direct) and how they appear in the EHR (attestations, countersignatures, tasks).

Get this right early and you drastically reduce "are we allowed to do this?" friction later.

### 3.2 EHR-first workflows: build once, use everywhere

MSOs struggle with **multiple EHRs, inconsistent templates, and manual reporting**.

Your CCM operating model should:

- Use **standard note types, templates, and smart phrases** that can be replicated across practices.
- Capture **eligibility, consent, care plan, time, and attestation** in a structured way.
- Make it obvious which minutes belong to CCM vs RPM vs other services.

Ask this of your team (or partner):

> "If an auditor looked only at the EHR, could they see exactly what we did and why we billed for CCM?"

If the honest answer is "maybe, but we'd have to pull spreadsheets," you don't have a real operating model yet.

### 3.3 Centralized care team: scale without hiring at every site

Workforce constraints are structural, not temporary. Most MSOs do **not** want to stand up care-management FTEs at every practice.

Instead, a shared-services CCM team lets you:

- **Pool clinical and non-clinical capacity** across practices
- Provide **coverage** for PTO, sick time, and demand spikes
- Avoid each site needing to hire "just for CCM"

You can build this team internally, or work with a partner that:

- Provides U.S.-based staff trained on CCM and your EHR
- Operates under your supervision policies and CPOM structure
- Documents directly in your EHR so clinicians see one source of truth

From a CFO's perspective, you're trading a **fixed FTE ramp** for a **variable service line** that can scale with adoption.

### 3.4 Enrollment & outreach: don't leave revenue on the table

MSOs often leave meaningful revenue on the table because they:

- Don't systematically identify eligible patients
- Rely on clinicians to "remember CCM" during busy visits
- Under-invest in proactive outreach and consent

A shared CCM engine should:

- Use EHR data to build **eligibility lists** by diagnosis, risk, and payer
- Provide **scripts and training** for consent—phone and in-clinic
- Track outreach, consent, enrollment, and engagement so you know exactly where each patient sits in the funnel

Treat CCM enrollment like a small growth engine, not an afterthought.

### 3.5 Documentation, billing & audit readiness

CCM is only valuable if it's **billable and defensible**.

Your model should ensure:

- Time is tracked **by program**, with one-provider-per-month safeguards
- Every interaction has a clear narrative (what was done, by whom, for which conditions, under whose supervision)
- You can quickly produce **logs and samples** for internal and payer audits

A shared service lets you refine **one documentation pattern** instead of fixing ten different local experiments.

### 3.6 Measurement & continuous improvement

Executives need more than "we enrolled 400 patients."

At a minimum, you want recurring views of:

**Panel metrics**
- Eligible vs enrolled
- Monthly engagement (patients meeting required minutes)

**Financial metrics**
- Claims submitted and paid for CCM codes
- Denials and reasons
- Net revenue per enrolled patient by payer

**Clinical & utilization metrics**
- ED visits and readmissions for CCM participants vs similar non-participants
- Selected chronic disease and preventive care measures

Over time, this lets you:

- Expand into RPM, BHI, PCM, and other programs
- Decide which practices or cohorts to prioritize
- Show your board that CCM is a **real service line**, not a science-fair project

## 4. A 90-day rollout plan for 10+ sites (without hiring)

Here is a realistic—but aggressive—timeline if you leverage a shared-services model instead of building everything on your own.

### Days 0–30: Design & governance

- Align executive sponsors (COO, CFO, CMO/medical director).
- Define which programs are in scope for phase one (often CCM, possibly plus a small RPM pilot).
- Finalize governance: CPOM-sensitive role definitions, management agreements, BAAs.
- Select initial sites (e.g., 3–5 practices representing different geographies or specialties).
- Begin EHR design: note types, task flows, time-tracking requirements.

**Outcome:** A documented operating model and implementation plan your clinical, compliance, and finance leaders can support.

### Days 31–60: Build, train & pilot

- Configure and test EHR artifacts in non-production or a pilot environment.
- Train the shared care team and local champions at the first wave of sites.
- Generate eligibility lists and start consent and initial outreach.
- Go live in a limited set of practices with close monitoring and daily/weekly huddles.
- Begin early reporting (enrollment, time logged, early revenue signals).

**Outcome:** A live CCM program in a subset of sites with real patients, real documentation, and a fast feedback loop.

### Days 61–90: Scale & optimize

- Roll out CCM to additional practices using the same templates and scripts.
- Tune cadences, scripts, and escalation rules based on pilot data.
- Stand up executive dashboards for practice-level and MSO-level views.
- Begin planning for adjacent programs (e.g., RPM, BHI, PCM) if CCM is performing well.

**Outcome:** CCM running across 10+ sites on a single operating model—without the MSO having to hire, train, and manage a new internal care-management department.

## 5. Pitfalls that trip up most MSOs

From the research and real-world experience, a few patterns show up repeatedly.

### Pitfall 1: Treating CCM as side work

Expecting already overloaded clinic staff to "fit in" CCM almost guarantees:

- Low enrollment
- Spotty documentation
- Poor patient experience

### Pitfall 2: Over-customizing per site

Every exception you allow creates another variant of CCM. That means:

- More training overhead
- Harder QA
- Higher audit exposure

Keep the operating model standard. Only allow exceptions when there is a truly material difference in how a site must work.

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring governance and CPOM

If nobody can clearly explain:

- Who is doing which parts of the CCM workflow
- Under which agreement
- Under whose supervision

…you're one email away from a compliance headache.

### Pitfall 4: Under-investing in measurement

Without consistent metrics, CCM will always feel squishy to finance and the board—even if it's doing important clinical work. That's usually when programs get cut.

### Pitfall 5: Picking the wrong starting cohort

Launching with the noisiest or least organized practices sets the program up to look chaotic. Start with sites that have:

- Enough volume
- Reasonable baseline operations
- Leaders who are willing to co-own the pilot

## 6. What "good" looks like after 6–12 months

By the one-year mark, a strong shared-services CCM program typically has:

- A **standard playbook** running across participating sites
- Clear visibility into high-risk panels: who is enrolled, engaged, and drifting
- A meaningful slice of **predictable monthly revenue** tied to CCM
- Fewer unpleasant audit surprises because documentation is consistent and traceable
- Clinicians saying, "I feel like someone finally has eyes on these complex patients between visits"

At that point, CCM isn't just a program; it's **infrastructure**—a platform you can build RPM, BHI, and other value-based services on top of.

## 7. Where LogicHM fits if you don't want to hire

You can absolutely build this internally.

But for many MSOs, the trade-offs are clear:

- Recruiting and retaining enough staff is already hard.
- EHR customization and cross-site standardization require significant IT and clinical ops bandwidth.
- Keeping up with coding, compliance, and program changes is a constant lift.

LogicHM's model is to act as your **centralized care-management team and operating model**, running CCM (and related programs) **inside your EHR**, under your governance, across your sites—without requiring you to add internal FTE.

Concretely, that means:

- A shared staff of U.S.-based RNs, MAs, and navigators executing CCM workflows across your network
- EHR-embedded templates, tasks, and time-tracking that support audit-ready documentation
- CPOM-sensitive role design and supervision workflows that keep physicians firmly in charge
- CFO-grade reporting on enrollment, revenue, and utilization trends by site and payer

If you'd like a concrete view of what a 90-day CCM rollout across your network could look like—with enrollment and revenue assumptions tuned to your payer mix—this is exactly the conversation we have with MSO COOs and CFOs every week.
