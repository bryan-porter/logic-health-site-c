CCM is one of the most reliable ways to improve outcomes **and** build sustainable revenue — *if* your workflows map cleanly to CMS requirements.

## Core Codes

### 99490 — Basic CCM (20 minutes)
- 20 minutes of clinical staff time per calendar month under general supervision.
- Document time, care plan updates, and coordination.

### 99439 — Each Additional 20 Minutes
- Add‑on to 99490.
- Use once for 20–39 minutes, twice for 40–59 minutes, etc.

### 99491 — CCM by a Physician or Other QHP
- 30 minutes of **direct** time by a physician/QHP.
- Not reported with 99490 in the same month.

## Documentation Tips

- Track **time to the minute** and **who performed** the work.
- Update and share **comprehensive care plans**.
- Log **care coordination** events (referrals, follow‑ups, medication changes).
- Capture **SDoH (Z‑codes)** when relevant to support care complexity.
