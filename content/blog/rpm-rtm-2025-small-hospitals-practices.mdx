Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) and Remote Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM) continue to mature. For **small hospitals** and **community practices**, the winning pattern in 2025 is **simple device logistics + disciplined monthly workflows**.

## Codes you'll encounter (confirm locally)
**RPM**
- **99453**: initial setup + education
- **99454**: device supply and daily recordings
- **99457/99458**: 20+ minutes of **interactive management** per month (+ additional)

**RTM** (often for musculoskeletal, respiratory, behavioral adherence)
- **98975/98976/98977**: setup/supply
- **98980/98981**: 20+ minutes management (+ additional)

> Keep management time separate from CCM/PCM logs to avoid double‑counting.

## A small‑team operating model
- **Device ops**: 1 coordinator handles inventory, shipping, and patient onboarding calls.
- **Clinical**: MA/LPN does first‑line outreach; RN reviews alerts; QHP documents assessments and plan.
- **Hospital variant**: central "virtual care hub" serves multiple clinics; standardize escalation to ED/inpatient.

## Documentation that stands up
- Patient consent & program enrollment
- Device type, **education given**, and start date
- Thresholds and **clinical response** rules
- **Interactive management minutes** tied to assessments/plan changes
- Patient messaging channels and response times

## Thresholds and noise control
Start conservative: one **primary alert** (e.g., sustained BP or SpO₂ deviations), one **secondary** (no data x 3 days). Review monthly and tighten. Too many alerts = lost minutes and clinician fatigue.

## Measuring value (minimum set)
- Activation rate within 7 days of order
- % patients with **15+ days** of data in month
- Average **management minutes** per enrolled patient
- ED visits / hospitalizations vs patient baseline

## Avoid the common traps
- **Device sprawl**: standardize on 1–2 vendors; simplify chargers, returns, replacements.
- **Month boundary mistakes**: log minutes & supply correctly to the **calendar month**.
- **No documentation of education**: 99453/98975 need real evidence of education and setup.

## A 45‑day launch plan
1. Pick 1–2 conditions (e.g., HTN, COPD).
2. Finalize device vendor(s) and return flow.
3. Build scripts for onboarding calls and education.
4. Add a **weekly exception review** with RN + QHP.
5. Enroll 30–50 patients; scale after week 6.
